The goal of this project is to create a custom filesystem in user space with FUSE. It includes implementing core operations like creating, reading, writing, and deleting files and directories, along with managing data and inode bitmaps. The project requires writing C programs to initialize a disk image and implement the filesystem using FUSE. Key objectives include understanding filesystem internals and learning to build a block-based filesystem.
